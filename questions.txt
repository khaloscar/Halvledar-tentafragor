What is the two major mechanisms of carrier scattering in semiconductors?
Phonon scattering and Ionized impurity scattering
Phonon scattering and ionized scattering, Phonon scattering and impurity scattering, Thermal collisions, Phonon scattering and Ionized impurity scattering
Phonons are particle representations of the vibrations of the atoms in the crystal. Crystal vibrations distort the periodic crystal structure and thus scatters the electron waves. Think of it as electrons scatters off of phonon particles. Ionized impurity scattering means that The fixed dopant ions (charged) affect the path of the electron as it travels. 

What is the temperature dependence of Phonon scattering mobility?
Decreasing proportional to T^-3/2
Decreasing proportional to T^-3/2, Increasing proportional to T^3/2, Increasing proportional to T^5/2, Decreasing proportional to T^-3/2
As temperature increase the phonon density increase and the speed of the electrons increase. Thus the mean free path of electrons colliding with phonons decrease with temperature and hence the mobility does too. Hint: Difference between mobility and scattering events

What is the temperature dependence of Ionized impurity scattering mobility?
Increasing proportional to T^3/2
Decreasing proportional to T^-3/2, Increasing proportional to T^3/2, Increasing proportional to T^5/2, Decreasing proportional to T^-3/2
The ionized dopant atoms remain more or less stationary. The speed of the electron increase with temperature. This means that as the electron travels it remains for a shorter time around a given ion and is thus less affected by coulumbic force. And so, ionized impurity scattering increase mobility increase with temperature.  Hint: Difference between mobility and scattering events

What is the relationship between electron mobility and scattering mechanisms??
Inversely proportional
Proportional, Inversely proportional, No dependence, Exponential
Electron mobility is determined by the mean free time. Higher mean free time betwen collisions means that the particle is more mobile. Scattering is related to how often collisions happen. Hence, inversely proportional.

Explain how a solar cell generates photocurrent
Photoelectric effect and hole-pair separation in the depletion region by diffusion
Photoelectric effect causes electrons to escape from the semiconductor surface into the external circuit, Photoelectric effect and hole-pair separation in the depletion region by diffusion, Incident light heats the semiconductor thus increasing carrier mobility and causing current flow, Photons excite electrons directly into the conduction band and recombination produces current flow
Photoelectric effect generates an electron hole pair in the semiconductor. If these pairs are generated typically within the diffusion length of the depletion region the hole-pair is separated by the internal field in the depletion region. Hence generating a current between the two terminals. This current is called the short-circuit current. 

What are the key parameters that determine the contact resistivity of an Ohmic contact?
Doping concentration and Schottky barrier height
Doping concentration and Schottky barrier height, Depletion width and material combination, Doping concentration and Temperature
Although dependence of contact resistivity is determined by a lot of factors. The main ones stated in the book is that Rc is proportional to exp(k * PhiB / sqrt(Nd)), k is some constant, PhiB barrier height and Nd doping concentration. It explicitly states "Low-resistance ohmic contacts are critical to the performance of high-current devices. The key ingredient of an ohmic contact is heavy doping of the semiconductor. A low Schottky barrier height is also desirable. The carrier transport mechanism is quantum-mechanical tunneling."

What is Piezoelectricity?
A relationship between structural deformation and voltage
A relationship between structural deformation and voltage, A relationship between structural deformation and resistivity
A piezoelectric material generates a voltage when it is deformed. The inverse can also happen, i.e. a voltage difference generates a deformation in the material. The charge on the material is leaky and gradually leaks away and the time retentions are short usually on the order of 1s.

What is Piezoresistivity?
A relationship between structural deformation and resistivity
A relationship between structural deformation and voltage, A relationship between structural deformation and resistivity
The applied stress alters a materials resistivity by changing the carrier mobility, carrier concentration or the band structure of the material. I.e, the stress gives rise to changes inter-atomic spacing. Usually the resistance change in metals is mostly due to the change of geometric, i.e crossectional area, this is not piezoresistivity. Meaning for most metals the change in geometry is the dominant effect while for semiconductors the change in inter-atomic spacing will change the bandgap and subsequently the intrinsic carrier concentration.

What material types can give rise to piezoelectricity?

Light absorption relationship to bandgap for semiconductors
I know
I know, I don't know
Lower bandgap means that a larger portion of the electromagnetic spectrum generates electron hole pairs. But since the bandgap is smaller the potential V = Eg/2q is smaller. Or a wider bandgap means that fewer electron-hole pairs can be generated but a higher voltage can be acheieved. It means that there is a optimal bandgap because electrical power is given by P = IV.

Draw a schematic cross section of NVM (flash) memory and explain how it works
I know
I know, I don't know
Charge is stored in the "charge storage" layer. Memory can be read by measuring 0 or 1 by checking Vt because it changes depending on amount of stored charge in the storage layer. When turning the device on with a high Vds electrons can tunnel through the thin insulating layer at remain trapped in the storage area. This is how you charge and discharge (write and erase) from memory. When no current pass through the device the storage layer remains charged for years, therefore it is non-volatile.

Draw a schematic cross section of DRAM memory and explain how it works
I know
I know, I don't know
In DRAM, each memory cell stores a bit of information as electric charge in a capacitor.
Because the capacitor slowly leaks charge over time, the memory must be continuously refreshed to preserve data. A word line (WL) controls access to the cell by turning on a transistor, which connects the cell’s capacitor to a bit line (BL). The BL is precharged to a reference voltage, typically VDD/2, before access. When the WL is activated, the BL voltage slightly shifts depending on whether the capacitor is charged (‘1’) or discharged (‘0’). A sense amplifier detects this small voltage difference, amplifies it to a full logic level, and restores the charge back to the capacitor. Cells are organized in a matrix of word lines (rows) and bit lines (columns), allowing the system to locate and address each stored bit precisely.

Draw a schematic cross section of SRAM memory and explain how it works
I know
I know, I don't know
In SRAM, each memory cell stores a bit of information as electric charge in bistable cicuit (a logical flip-flop) made out of transistors, which maintains its state as long as power is supplied. The logical flipflop maintains the state of the memory (0 or 1), no need for refreshing. During read, Writeline opens the cell and BL and BLC are pre-charged. If BL goes up and BLC goes down it means a logical 1 is stored in the cell. If BL goes down and BLC goes up it means a logical 0 is stored. An amplifier amplifies the small change to a 1 or a 0 which is then used later.  During write either BL is set to high or low (and BLC set to inverse of BL). The memory cells are organized in a matrix of word lines and bit lines, allowing data to be accessed efficiently by row and column addressing.

If the semiconductor in a MOSFET is of P-type why is it called NFET and PFET if it is of N-type?
FET type is determined by the inversion characteristics
Science bitch, It is not like this (NFET is N-type), FET type is determined by the inversion characteristics
A FET (Field effect transistor) allows current to pass from source to drain when the device is in inversion mode. Hence, N-type works as P-type in inversion -> PFET, and P-type works as N-type in inversion -> NFET.
